# half-baked
A collection of one-off, messy, or hard-coded scripts that could be useful down the line.

When a new script is added, please alter this readme to include the script name under a broad category and provide a brief description of its purpose and any particularly useful tidbits that would help someone else run it or what could be changed to make it full-baked.
